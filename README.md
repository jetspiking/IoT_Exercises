# IoT Exercises repository description
This course has a mixed bag of example projects for the IoT-Avans-Course. The course starts with a relatively simple introduction with different programming exercises. The Espressif ESP32 Dev Module has been used for the wiring.   

All exercises have been programmed in Visual Studio Code with the PlatformIO plugin.  

# Finite State Machine TrafficLight

**Project Description**  
This project applies the FSM design pattern in combination with two traffic lights. These lights can switch states, depending on a button press or timer. 

**Hardware Overview**
